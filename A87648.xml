         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOOD and Lawfull men was the Character of thoſe firſt aſſigned to Keep the Peace in every County, <hi>1 Ed. 3. c. 16.</hi> and by <hi>4 Ed. 3. c. 2. §. 1. N. 3.</hi> And to this day that Phraſe doth moſt properly ſhew, the Intendment of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, was either to find, or to make men ſuch; for before this time, Sheriffs, and Leets, and other particular Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had ſo divided this Juriſdiction, that it is a hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether it were more difficult to procure a Beneficial Law of Publick Good to be made, or to be put in Execution, neither of which could then be done without much Self-denyal: wherefore they who ſay the former days were better than theſe, have doubtleſs not rightly conſidered this matter; for as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as our Laws yet ſeem to be, I have not yet read of any more certain, tho I have uſed ſome endeavours of Compariſon, Chiefly with the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Laws, whereof in ſuch as are of General Reaſon different from ours, as in Villinage, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy, Diſcents, Tenures, Cuſtomes, Aprentices, Judicatures, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Stews, and many other particulars they are, our Legiſlators have ever preferred the Reaſon of our own Laws before them, and indeed they are in the main point of Government, rather Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of Power, than Maintainers of Juſtice: Whereas ours have ever been Intent upon Publick Good, as appears in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws for the due preſervation of the Peace, the Management and Care whereof is placed in ſuch men in every County, that may be able to hinder the Oppreſſions of the Great, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections and Diſturbances of the Poor, almoſt Habitually practiſed before this Statute; for whoſe Service I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured this preſent <hi>Aſſiſtance:</hi> Wherein, Firſt are placed ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:172058:5"/>
Clauſes of the laſt Edition of the Statutes in Paragraphs or Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Numbers that give to the Juſtices any expreſs power to Act; ſome of which alone are only mentioned in the end of <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the laſt Edition of <hi>Dalton,</hi> but here fully: So that the Juſtice need only look the Statute Book to ſee whether it be in Force or not. But the nature and limits of his Power appears in each Clauſe, and is generally pointed to in a Marginal Note of the Matter, whereby Juſtices may ſoon diſcern the Circumſpection of their Duty, and what it is that is required of them, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. After which Foundation laid, it will be neceſſary, <hi>2.</hi> To conſider the Nature and Extent of their Commiſſion, wherein there will ſome difficulties ariſe, as well from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Superiours, as from the Irregular Motions of Inferiours; and therefore for the better underſtanding of this Commiſſion in <hi>tit. Juſtices,</hi> I have divided that alſo by Paragraphs or Sections and Numbers for eaſier Intendment of, or reference to any part of it; the due conſideration whereof, will ſomething facilitate the work, whether in Seſſions or out of Seſſions. And Thirdly, that doubts about particular matters may at leaſt be leſſened, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, I have added ſuch Heads of Common Place as ſeemed convenient, wherein the former Treatices about Juſtices of Peace are moſtly reduced to the proper Authors, or at leaſt the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes (they mention only in General) are more particularly Cited, whereby any Juſtice of Peace may by help of a Statute Book, be able to make a much readier Judgment than before; and he that deſires fuller ſatisfaction, muſt take more pains to ſearch the Tables, Abridgements, and other Books of Law, not ſo fit here to be inſerted; for I have only aimed at what more immediately refers to Keeping of the Peace, not at the particular nature and Extent of the Head or Common Place it ſelf: and in each Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Clauſe, and Reference, I have added in the Margent, a Notice or Head of the matter thereof, and this being but as a Table or Common Place it ſelf, I think needs no other Table to it. And therefore in the Fourth Place, I have only made a Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation or Recital of the leſſer and larger Heads as they refer each to other, or rather as they may be referred each to other. And in the laſt place, I have acquainted you with the manner of my Quotations, which are thus,

Now againſt theſe Witches being the moſt cruel, revengeful, and bloudy of all the reſt, the Juſtices of Peace may not always expect direct Evidence, ſeeing all their works are the works of darkneſs, and no witneſſes preſent with them to accuſe them; and therefore for their better diſcovery, I thought good here to inſert cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain obſervations, partly out of the Book of diſcovery of the Witches that were Arraigned at <hi>Lancaſter, An. Dom.</hi> 1612. before Sir <hi>James Altham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Bromley,</hi> Judges of Aſſize there, and partly out of Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> Guide to Grand-Jury-men, <hi>Bolt.</hi> J. P. 97. cap. 23.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Witches have ordinarily a Familiar or Spirit, which appeareth unto them ſometimes in one ſhape, ſometimes in another, as of a Man, Woman, Boy, Dog, Cat, Foal, Fowl, Hare, Rat, Toad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to theſe their Spirits they give Names, and they meet together to Chriſten them, as they ſpeak, <hi>Bern.</hi> 107, 113.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their ſaid Familiar hath ſome big or little Teat upon their Body, where he ſucketh them; and beſides their ſucking, the Devil leaveth other marks upon their Body, ſometimes like a blue ſpot, or red ſpot like a Flea-biting, ſometimes the fleſh ſunk in and hollow, all which for a time may be covered, yea taken away, but will come again to their old form; and theſe the Devils marks be inſenſible, and being pricked will not bleed, and be often in their ſecreteſt parts, and therefore require diligent and careful ſearch, <hi>Bern.</hi> 112, 219. Theſe firſt two are main points to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and convict theſe Witches, for they prove fully, that thoſe Witches have a Familiar, and made a League with the Devil, <hi>Bern.</hi> 60. So likewiſe if the ſuſpected be proved to have been heard to call upon their Spirit, or to talk to them, or of them, or have offered them to others; ſo if they have been ſeen with their Spirit, or ſeen to feed ſomething ſecretly, theſe are proofs they have a Familiar, &amp;c. <hi>Bolt.</hi> 97. cap. 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have often Pictures of Clay or Wax, like a Man, &amp;c. made of ſuch as they would bewitch, found in their Houſe, or which they roaſt or bury in the Earth, that as the Picture conſumes, ſo may the parties bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched conſume, <hi>Bolt.</hi> 97. cap. 23.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And it was adjudged that the Plea of the Defendant was inſufficient; 1ſt. For that he was not preſent at the Aſſault and Affray; and 2d. For that he was the High-Conſtable of the Hundred, and not Conſtable of the Town.<note place="margin">Peace.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the argument of this Caſe, <hi>Anderſon</hi> held Conſtables to be Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of the Peace at the Common-Law, and ſtill ſo to be; and that they ought to preſerve the Peace as much as in them lieth. <hi>But that</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>was by parting of men which he ſhould ſee breaking of the Peace, and to carry them before a Juſtice of Peace, to find Sureties for keeping thereof; but to take Sureties himſelf the Constable cannot.</hi>

                  <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid he knew not; and that it ſhould be very inconvenient to give ſuch Authority to every Conſtable. But by <hi>Walmeſly, Owen</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> although a Conſtable cannot take Surety of the Peace by Recognizance nor Bail, yet he may take an Obligation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Surety, Br.</hi> 26. And if the Affray be in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they are Conſervators of the Peace, and therefore may uſe ſuch

means for the keeping of the Peace, by taking Surety by Obligation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And that before Juſtices of Peace were, the Peace was preſerved, and that by Conſtables; and that Statute (1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. St. 2. cap. 16.) which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Juſtices of Peace, did not take away the authority of the Conſtable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But the Conſtable hath no authority to take an Oath of the party,<note place="margin">Oath.</note> that he is in fear, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whereunto <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice replied, I doubt not but that at the Common-Law the Peace was kept, but that was to be done in ſuch manner as the Law appointed, and that is by Writ out of the Chancery, or <hi>B. R.</hi>

of theſe do follow the preciſe Letter of the Law, which requireth but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly four Quarter Seſſions in every year, yet every of them draweth near to the true meaning of the Law, which looketh for nothing elſe but that the Court of theſe Seſſions ſhould yearly be four times opened for the whole County.</p>

For that 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 31. <hi>N.</hi> 2. refers only to the Caſe of Impriſonment, that where the Offender by preaching, teaching, or words is Impriſoned, and is not Indicted within half a year after the offence committed, he ſhall be ſet at liberty and ſhall be no longer detained in priſon for any ſuch cauſe or offence, and this was done in favour of liberty, and to prevent a long Impriſonment upon a malicious and groundleſs accuſation; but there is no colour to extend the words to the Offender, who was never Impriſoned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the offence was by preaching, teaching, or words only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Put the Caſe, that an Offender by preaching, teaching, or words, had been Impriſoned within the half year, yet it ſeems very queſtionable, whether at the half years end, when he was ſet at liberty (as he ought to be by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. § 31. <hi>N.</hi> 2. if he be not in the mean time indicted) he ſhould have been clearly diſcharged by this Act from any proſecution, during the half year then next following, for altho it be ſaid (he ſhall be no longer detained in priſon for any ſuch cauſe or offence) yet that ſeems to refer only to his Impriſonment before Conviction, and <hi>(detained)</hi> imports as much, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould not be continued or remain in the ſame Impriſonment, which he ſuffered within the firſt half year, before any Indictment was found againſt him, but not that he ſhould not be indicted afterwards within the compaſs of the year, and if found guilty, ſuffer the Impriſonment and other penalties inflicted by this Act; and it might ſo have happened, that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender by preaching, teaching, or words, might have been accuſed, taken, and Impriſoned a day or two before the half year next after the offence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, in which Caſe it cannot be thought to be the meaning of the makers of the Law, that by his Impriſonment for a day or two he ſhould eſcape the penalties of the Law, and could not be afterwards indicted within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the year, and yet in that Caſe he ought to be ſet at liberty by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of the Act, which ſaith <hi>(he ſhall be ſet at liberty if not indicted within half a year after the offence)</hi> and not half a year after his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:172058:276"/>3.

               <p>This hear you, Sir Coroner, that I <hi>J.

                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:172058:285"/>For the Solving of which Doubt, it is to be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Biſhop, and not the Juſtices of Aſſize, are here joyned with the Juſtices of Peace; And theſe words, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. <hi>(where any Biſhop or Juſtices of Peace)</hi> ſeem to bear this Conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> Either the one or the other indifferently may require the Oath, and that can be intended only of the Power given out of Seſſions; for in Seſſions the Biſhop hath nothing to do.</p>
               <p>But had the Juſtices of Aſſize been here added, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in all Caſes where the Biſhop, Juſtices of Aſſize, or Juſtices of Peace may require this Oath, it had been clear that the Power here 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. given the ſix Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Counſellors, was as Extenſive as that which 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 14. <hi>N.</hi> 3. is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Juſtices of Aſſize, or Juſtices of Peace in their Seſſions, and they might have required the Oath of any Noble man or unmarried Noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whatſoever of competent Age. So if the Juſtices of Peace only had been here named, it had been clearly intended of the Juſtices of Peace in either Capacity, either in or out of Seſſions. But <hi>(Biſhop)</hi> 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 4. § 41. <hi>N.</hi> 1. ſeems here to be a Reſtrictive word, and to give the Privy Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors no more power in reſpect of the Nobility, than the Biſhop had in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any other Subjects.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

For by the Statute 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. § 26. <hi>N.</hi> 5.

Now it cannot be preſumed that the Makers of the Law intended any difference between the Perſons to he licenced by the King or Privy Counſellors, and the Perſons to be licenced by the Juſtices of Peace; the Power given 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 1. to the King or Privy Counſellors, being more abſolute, and not under ſuch Precautions as is that which is given 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 3. to the Juſtices of Peace: For the King or Privy Counſellors may grant a Licence to the Recuſant to travel without any particular Cauſe ſhewn in the Licence, or the aſſent of any other Perſon, and without any Oath to be made by the Recuſant, which the Juſtices of Peace cannot do: And there is no reaſon to think that the Power here given to the King or Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, which in all other Particulars is ſo much more abſolute and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than that given to the Juſtices of Peace, ſhould be yet leſs Extenſive as to the Perſons to be licenced.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Again, If a Felony be done, there is no doubt but that every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, without a Warrant, may Arreſt whomſoever he ſuſpecteth of it, being a Man of Evil Fame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if the Offender, being purſued ſhall reſiſt, <hi>Quaere</hi> who ſhall be aiding to a Private Man whoſe Goods are ſtoln, and who ſuſpecteth another to have ſtoln them, either to ſearch for his Goods, or to apprehend the Party ſuſpected, if the Juſtice of Peace by his Warrant ſhall not command the Conſtable to aid him therein: If it be objected, that the Conſtable may do all this of his own Authority upon requeſt to him made by the Party Robbed; be it true, yet we find by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience that the Conſtables, without the Juſtices Warrant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are for the moſt part both very fearful, and alſo remiſs herein, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowing their own Authority, nor the Danger.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="2">2. But others there be that do ſavor of a more general Diſobedience, and be in regard of the Number or Quarel, a very Seed of Rebellion, if not the Weed it ſelf, and are therefore alſo ſometimes Called <hi>Rumors,</hi> great Ridings, Routs and Riots againſt the Peace, 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 6 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 2. 6.

                  <pb n="645" facs="tcp:172058:325"/>4. A Rout ſaith <hi>Marrow,</hi> is ſuch a Company ſo aſſembled for their own common Quarel, as where the Inhabitants of a Townſhip come forceably together to throw down a Hedge, Ditch, or Pale, in Claiming their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 61. § 4.</p>
               <p>Or to Beat a Man that hath done unto them ſome publick Offence or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>St.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 159. § <hi>N.</hi> ſpeaking of Routs that are brought into the preſence of the Juſtices, and 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 7. that treateth of Riding in great Routs to make entry into Lands, to beat Men, or to carry away their Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ſeem to underſtand the word Rout in a more ample and large meaning, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 217. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p>And therefore I will deſcribe it thus. A Rout is a diſordered Aſſembly of three or more Perſons moving forward to commit by force an unlawful Act; for it is a Rout whether they put their purpoſe in full Execution or no, if ſo be that they go, ride, or move forward after their firſt moving. <hi>Riot, Br.</hi> 4 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A Riot is thought to be where three or more Perſons be diſorderly Aſſembled to commit with force any ſuch unlawful Act, and do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Execute the ſame, of the French Riotter to ſcold or brawl, becauſe ſuch manner of Acts be commonly accompanied with words of brawl, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 61. § 2. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 217. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thus upon the whole Reekning an unlawful Aſſembly is the firſt degree or beginning, a Rout the next ſtep or proceeding, and a Riot the full Effect and conſummation of a Diſordered and forbidden Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Lambert</hi> 176, 177, 178. But howſoever that ſtands, two ſpecial things there are that be common, and muſt concur both in the unlawful Aſſembly, Rout, and Riot. 1. That three Perſons at the leaſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together; for ſo it is commonly holden at this day, as I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. That their being together do Breed ſome apparent Diſturbance of the Peace, either by ſignification of Speech, ſhew of Armor, turbulent Geſture, or Actual and Expreſs Violence: So that either the Peaceable ſort of Men be unquieted and feared by the Fact, or the lighter ſort and buſie Bodies be imboldned by the Example, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 218. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in theſe matters not only the Fact it ſelf, but alſo the manner of doing the ſame, falleth ſometime juſtly into Conſideration, in ſo much as the Lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of the thing it ſelf that is done, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, doth not always excuſe or accuſe the Parties to a Riot, Rout, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Aſſembly, but ſo that the manner and Circumſtance of the doing muſt alſo be brought into Judgment with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And therefore, ſaith Mr. <hi>Marrow,</hi> the manner of the doing of a lawful thing may make it unlawful, as if many in one Company Riding or going to the Seſſions, Fair, Market, or Church it ſelf, will ride or go Armed to the terror of the People; for although it be not only lawful, but meet and neceſſary alſo to go to the Church and Seſſions, yet to go in ſuch ſhew, it is altogether needleſs, diſordered, and againſt the Law, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 62. § 74. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 221. <hi>cap.</hi> 87.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So if three or more ſhall enter into Land with a force, where their entry is otherwiſe lawful.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And contrarywiſe, an Aſſembly to do a wrong, ſaith he, may be ſo handled that it ſhall prove none of theſe Offences; as if I gather meet Company together to carry away a piece of Timber, which will not be moved without a good many, whereto I pretend right, though in Law it be another mans, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 219. 220. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="646" facs="tcp:172058:326"/>6. And ſo alſo to do an unlawful thing, as if many do meet to play at Bowls, Tables, or Cards, and do uſe no miſbehaviour againſt the Peace, they are not puniſhable in this degree, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 61 b. §. 6.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And yet if he that carrieth the Piece of Timber away will uſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, as to ſay, that he will carry it in ſpight of him that hath it; or that he will have it though he dye for it, or ſuch like; his doing may then become a Riot, by <hi>Marrow, Crompt.</hi> 61 b. §. 8.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Lambert</hi> 178, 179, 180. Furthermore, the Intention and purpoſe of thoſe that be Aſſembled is worthy the weighing, for to uſe Horns on <hi>Midſomer</hi>-night in <hi>London</hi> or on <hi>May-day</hi> in the County for ſport only, is no ſuch Offence, ſeeing no terror followeth it; and the words <hi>in terrorem populi,</hi> ſeem to be material in an Indictment of this kind, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 61. § 7. 64. § 43. 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. Riots <hi>Br.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So if the Sheriff or his Bailiff do levy People to ſerve the Kings Writ of <hi>Capias,</hi> or if a Conſtable do gather Aſſiſtance of Men with weapon to part an Affray, it maketh no Riot, 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So if a Man, hearing that another will fetch him out of his Houſe and beat him, do aſſemble company with force, it will be no unlawfull Aſſembly, for his Houſe is his hold and Caſtle, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 64. <hi>pl.</hi> 42. &amp; 70. <hi>pl.</hi> 2. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 217. <hi>cap.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if he be only threatned that he ſhall be beaten, if he go to the Market, then may he not aſſemble Company for his aid, becauſe he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to go thither, and he may provide for himſelf by Surety of the Peace, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>per Fineux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. And if many be aſſembled, and none of them knoweth to what end, it can make no Rout nor Riot, as <hi>Marrow</hi> thought, till the Intent be known; for if the Maſter intend to make a Riot, and take his uſual Servants with him, not foretelling them what he intended to do, and then committeth an Outrage with them, this is no Riot in them; for although he ſhall be puniſhed, they ſhall be Excuſed. But otherwiſe it is if he make them privy to his purpoſe, for then they alſo ſhall be puniſhed, by <hi>Marrow,</hi> and Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Daliſon, Crompt.</hi> 61 b. 62. § 13.</p>
               <p>And in the former Caſe it is not material, whether his number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be above his degree, or no, ſo long as they be his Menials or Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold men, <hi>Daliſon, Dalt.</hi> 220. <hi>cap.</hi> 86.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If many be at an Alehouſe, a Chriſtmas-Dinner, or Church-Ale and without any intent of an Affray they ſodainly fall together by the Ears, and make it <hi>Lapitharum Convivium,</hi> yet this is no Riot, but a ſodain Affray, becauſe they had no ſuch Intention, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 61 b. § 12.</p>
               <p>But if in that Affray they ſhall be taken themſelves to ſundry parts, it may become a Riot, as <hi>Marrow</hi> thinketh, for then it is not the firſt, but a new Aſſembly as it were in his meaning.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if twelve Jurors being committed to their Keeper, do fall out, and fight ſix againſt ſix, this maketh no Riot, ſaith <hi>Marrow,</hi> becauſe they were lawfully Aſſembled, and were compelled to be in company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if a number of Women or Children, under the Age of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, do flock together for their own Cauſe, this is none Aſſembly puniſhable by theſe Statutes, unleſs a Man of Diſcretion moved them to aſſemble for the doing of ſome unlawfull act, as <hi>M.</hi>E. <hi>Marrow</hi> writeth, <hi>Dalt.</hi> 222. <hi>cap.</hi> 88.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="647" facs="tcp:172058:326"/>Yet I remember well, that not many years ago, ſundry Women were puniſhed in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and that worthily, becauſe putting off that ſhamefaſtneſs which beſeemeth their Sex, they Arraied themſelves in the Attire of Men, and aſſembling in great number, they moſt riotouſly pulled down a lawful Incloſure, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 62. <hi>infra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Finally, <hi>Marrow</hi> noteth, that if the Mayor and Commonalty of a Town do Aſſemble and make a Rout in their Common Quarel, this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhall be Judged and puniſhed in their Natural Perſons, and not in their Body Politick, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 62. § 18.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Lambert.</hi> 167, 168. The <hi>Stat.</hi> 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3. of <hi>Northampton</hi> is of late days frequently put in ure for the puniſhment of forcible Entries, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 71 b. 72 a. <hi>Poult. de Pace</hi> 40. §. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Law 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3. in Effect, and for this purpoſe, is thus; No Man whatſoever, except the Kings Servants and Miniſters in his Preſence, or in Executing his Precepts, or their Offices, and ſuch as ſhall aſſiſt them, and except it be upon loyal Proclamation made for Arms to keep the Peace and that in places where ſuch Acts do happen, be ſo hardy to come before the Kings Juſtices or other his Miniſters doing their Office with force and Arms.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3. § 1. <hi>N.</hi> 2. Nor bring any force in Affray of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p n="13">13. And in this point, it differeth by the Opinion of <hi>Marrow,</hi> from the Arreſt of Felon, by Hue and Cry; for there, ſaith he, when they have once delivered the Felon unto the Sheriff, they are no longer compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to wait upon him.</p>

The Arreſt thus made, theſe Juſtices,<note place="margin">Record.</note> Sheriff, or Under-Sheriff, ought to make a Record in writing of that which they ſee and find; the which ſince it is a Conviction in it ſelf againſt the Offenders, ought to be formal and certain as well for the time and place, as for the Number, Weapon, manner, and other Circumſtances; for the Parties ſhall be concluded thereby, and ſhall not be received to traverſe or deny it, becauſe the view of a Riot, as Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> ſaith, is not to be traverſed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="654" facs="tcp:172058:331"/>2. Inſomuch as if they either do Record that they ſaw a Riot, wherein truth there was none at all, or that it do afterwards appear by the Record it ſelf, that that Act which they recorded doth not amount to a Riot, yet be the Parties without any remedy, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 63. <hi>pl.</hi> 33. 65. <hi>pl.</hi> 55, 56. <hi>Dalt.</hi> 109. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. <hi>infra.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. And if a Man be bound to the Peace, and afterwards ſuch a Record of a Riot is made againſt him and others, he ſhall neither juſtifie, as Mr. <hi>Marrow</hi> holdeth, nor plead not Guilty in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> upon his Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If therefore a Man be ſlain or maimed, or a Reſcous done to the Officer by ſuch a Riot, then the Record ought to be <hi>Riotoſe occiderunt,</hi> or <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otoſe Mahemaverunt,</hi> or <hi>Riotoſe Reſcuſſerunt,</hi> and not <hi>Felonice</hi> nor ſimply <hi>Reſcuſſerunt,</hi> becauſe their Authority in this Caſe is reſtrained to the Riot only, and extendeth not to the Felony.</p>
               <p>But ſo that the Parties may, notwithſtanding that Record, plead not Guilty to the Felony, or to the Reſcous, howſoever for the Riot they are Eſtopt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this Record ought to remain with the one of them, and they, and none other Juſtices of the Peace, ſhall Impriſon the Rioters and aſſeſs their Fine, by <hi>Marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Fine they are willed by 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 8. § 2, <hi>N.</hi> 4. to put in greater Sums then they were wont to be put in ſuch Caſes, for ſupportation of the Coſts of the ſaid Juſtices, and other Officers in this behalf, as well in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tarrying, as retorning, whereof payment ought to be made by the Sheriff by Indenture thereof between him and them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if the Rioters ſhall Eſcape after that theſe Juſtices, Sheriff, or Under-Sheriff, do come and ſee the Riot, then can they neither Arreſt them at any other time, ſaith Mr. <hi>Marrow,</hi> nor Award Proceſs againſt them upon that Record which they do make, <hi>Crompt.</hi> 63 b. <hi>pl.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>And then that Record muſt be ſent into <hi>B. R.</hi> from which place Proceſs may be made upon it, where alſo the Parties ſhall not be admitted to any Traverſe, but muſt of neceſſity make Fine for their Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now, if theſe Juſtices, Sheriff, or Under-Sheriff, ſhall go to ſee one Riot, and then another Riot falleth out in their preſence, yet may they make a Record of that, by <hi>Marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if they be aſſembled for ſome other Cauſe of Service, or for ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate buſineſs; as for an Arbitrement or ſuch like matter; and a Riot happeneth to be committed in their ſight, they may Record it, by <hi>Marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Likewiſe if the Rioters ſhall make a Riot upon the Juſtices and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff that do come of purpoſe to Arreſt them from the former Riot, they may Record that alſo, by <hi>Marrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo may they, as I think, Record any Riot that ſhall be done upon themſelves, whilſt they be aſſembled for any other Cauſe than for to ſuppreſs a Riot, though Mr. <hi>Marrow</hi> ſeemeth to deny it.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Lambert.</hi> 318. 319.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. For although the words of the Statute 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 7. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 2. do make the Certificate equal in force with the Verdict of 12.

               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="6">6. However, where the Statute 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 7. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 1. willeth that they ſhall certifie before the King and his Council, it ſeemeth to me that the ſame ought to be done, either to the Body (and Boord of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or into the Star-Chamber at the leaſt, becauſe that the Statute it ſelf doth by expreſs words 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 7. § 3. <hi>N.</hi> 3. diſtinguiſh the King and his Counſel here both from the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and from the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> which in many other Caſes be taken for the King and his Council alſo, <hi>Crompt.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. But now, if two Juſtices and the Sheriff go to ſee a Riot, and other two Juſtices make the enquiry, then the one ſort, or the other of them, with the Sheriff, or Under-Sheriff, may make the Certificate, by <hi>Marrow, Dalt.</hi> 121. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

               <p n="10">10. And the ſame Rule muſt hold where the Enquiry and Certificate ſhall diſagree; for if the Enquiry ſhall find that the Riot was made by twelve Perſons, where in truth it was made by a hundred; or if the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be of twelve perſons, and the truth is that thoſe twelve were Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſed; or if the Endictment be of a Riotous Aſſault only, and the Riotous did both make an Aſſault and did beat and Wound, in theſe and the like Caſes the Certificate may well be made ſo, as the omiſſion in the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be ſupplied by it, by <hi>Marrow, Crompt.</hi> 63 b. <hi>pl.</hi> 37. 39</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>Lambert</hi> 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.

Yea, and many times hearing of ſuch Precepts for the Peace, and miſliking to be bound in the Country, they go up to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and give Surety of the Peace there, either in <hi>B.

               <p>And if he make default, that being recorded, ſhall be ſufficient to cauſe him to forfeit the Penalty of the Recognizance, although the Juſtice that Awarded it ſhall omit to bring in the Recognizance it ſelf, according as he ought now to do by the Statute 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. § <hi>N.</hi> and this may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon the Opinion 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. and may alſo be ſeen by this form of the <hi>Superſedeas</hi> here under written <hi>Dalt.</hi> 365. <hi>cap.</hi> 122.</p>
